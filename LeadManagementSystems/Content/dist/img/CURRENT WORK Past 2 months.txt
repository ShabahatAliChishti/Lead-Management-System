Q why its fetching wrong record
Fetching the record wrongly but its ok in db
Document number is from 1 table master and ref document is iving us the price
issue in returncashmemoaddnew sp is not working fine
check while making cash memo the price is less and when generating it in view than price is different
queries will help yoou find the document num and their price from the table transaction master and doucument ref
select * from TRANSACTION_MASTER where Document_No = 'CM-1306191011-00004'

Select * From TRANSACTION_MASTER where Ref_Document = 15885

Select * From TRANSACTION_DETAIL where Transaction_Id= 15886
